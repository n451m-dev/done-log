            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> <span>25 January, 2025</span>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how DoneLog collects, uses, and protects
                your information
                when you use our Chrome extension.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>DoneLog does not collect any personal data from users. However, we may store the following locally in
                your browser:</p>
            <li>To-do task details (entered by you).</li>
            <li>Timestamps related to task management.</li>
            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>Your data is only used locally to provide the to-do tracking functionality.</p>
            <p>If you choose to push tasks to Google Sheets, the extension will store tasks within your own Google
                account.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Data Storage</h3>
            <p>All to-do data is stored locally in your browser's local storage and, optionally, in your Google Sheet if
                you connect
                your account. We do not store or have access to your data on our servers.</p>

            <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>We use Google APIs to push your to-do tasks to your Google Sheet. Google's privacy policies apply when
                you authenticate
                and use this feature.</p>

            <h3>5. Your Choices and Controls</h3>
            <p>You can clear your stored tasks at any time through the extension interface. You can also revoke Google
                account access
                through your Google security settings.</p>

            <h3>6. Security Measures</h3>
            <p>We take reasonable steps to secure your data stored locally. However, you are responsible for keeping
                your Google account and data secure when using the extension.</p>

            <h3>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated through the
                extension update
                or via our support channels.</p>

            <h3>8. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at khannasimahmad@gmaail.com.
